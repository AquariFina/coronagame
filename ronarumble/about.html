      <p class="b">About Rona Rumble!</p>
      <br>

      <p class="a"> Trapped inside a box with nothing to defend yourself from COVID-19 besides your trusty disinfectant spray bottle, how long can you stay healthy? The molecules may pass but their lingering auras will remain, threatening your mobility. Search for spray bottle refills and other powerups to survive as long as you can!
      <br>
      <br>
      Rona Rumble was made within 36 hours during the Florida International Universityâ€™s ShellHacks 2020 hackathon. It was developed in c++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). <br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="a">
       We were inspired by the day to day struggles that many face going about their lives in these unsure times and thought that the best way to represent that feeling is to model the restrictions that COVID put on people's lives inside of a video game. Our group, though on all sides of the world, share similar experiences regarding COVID-19, and it is this profound shared experience that helped us to unify and create this game. We hope you enjoy it.
